 * Generic, agent-agnostic type contracts for the privacy engine.

 * IMPORTANT: nothing in `privacy-engine/core`, `privacy-engine/detection`,
 * `privacy-engine/redaction`, or `privacy-engine/fusion` may import from
 * NanoBrowser (`@src/background/*`). Only files under `privacy-engine/adapters/*`
 * are allowed to know about a specific host agent.
 *
 * This is our team's original contribution for the SIH problem statement.
 * It does not claim any upstream NanoBrowser functionality as original work;
 * NanoBrowser-specific glue lives exclusively in `privacy-engine/adapters/nanobrowser`.
